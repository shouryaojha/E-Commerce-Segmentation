Customer Segmentation in E-Commerce
Problem Statement
E-commerce businesses need to understand customer behavior to tailor marketing strategies and improve customer satisfaction. This project aims to segment customers into distinct groups based on their purchasing habits and browsing behavior using unsupervised machine learning.

Objective
The goal of this project is to:

Analyze and preprocess customer data from an e-commerce dataset.

Identify meaningful clusters of customers using KMeans Clustering.

Visualize the clusters and feature correlations.

Provide insights that can help in targeted marketing and customer relationship management.

Dataset
Name: Customer Segmentation in E-commerce.csv
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository / Kaggle
Features may include:

Purchase frequency

Average transaction value

Time spent on website

Product categories

Other behavioral and transaction metrics

Technologies Used
Python 3

Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

Libraries:

pandas, numpy – Data manipulation

seaborn, matplotlib – Data visualization

sklearn – Clustering, PCA, scaling, evaluation

Implementation Steps
Upload and load the dataset

Data cleaning – remove missing values and non-numeric features

Feature scaling using StandardScaler

Apply KMeans clustering

Determine optimal clusters using the Elbow Method

Visualize clusters using PCA for 2D projection

Analyze feature correlation with heatmaps

Evaluate clustering quality using Silhouette Score

Expected Outcomes
Identification of customer segments such as high spenders, frequent buyers, and window shoppers

Visual separation of clusters

Correlation between features to understand customer behavior

Actionable insights for e-commerce strategy, marketing, and product recommendations

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how unsupervised learning techniques like clustering can be effectively used for customer segmentation in e-commerce. By grouping customers based on their behavior, businesses can personalize experiences, optimize product offerings, and ultimately improve retention and revenue.

Future Enhancements
Use t-SNE or UMAP for deeper non-linear cluster visualization

Implement DBSCAN or Hierarchical Clustering for comparison

Add demographics or regional data for richer segmentation
